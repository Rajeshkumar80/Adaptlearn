MODULE –1 
CHAPTER 1 --INTRODUCTION 
Software and Software Engineering 
 
Software Engineering is the product of two words, software, and engineering. 
 
Software is more than just a program code. A program is an executable code, which serves some 
computational purpose. Software is considered to be a collection of executable programming code, 
associated libraries and documentations. Software, when made for a specific requirement is called a 
software product. 
 
Engineering on the other hand, is all about developing products, using well-defined, scientific 
principles and methods. 
Software Engineering is an engineering branch associated with development of software product 
using well-defined scientific principles, methods and procedures. The outcome of software 
engineering is an efficient and reliable software product. 
Definitions 
 
IEEE defines software engineering as: 
 
(1) The application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, 
operation and maintenance of software; that is, the application of engineering to software. 
 
(2) The study of approaches as in the above statement. 
 
Fritz Bauer, a German computer scientist, defines software engineering as: Software engineering 
is the establishment and use of sound engineering principles in order to obtain economically software 
that is reliable and work efficiently on real machines. 
 
1.1 The Nature of software 
Software takes on a dual role. It is a Product and at the same time a Vehicle (Process) for 
delivering a product. 
 
As a Product, it produces, manages, modifies, acquires and displays the information–It is an 
information transformer that can be a single bit or a complex multimedia presentation delivered 
from data acquired from dozens of independent sources. 
 
As a Vehicle (Process), delivers the product. Software acts as the basis for: 
 
Control of other computer(Operating Systems) 

SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT (BCS501) 
 
 
 
 
Communication of Information(Networks) 
 
Creation and control of other programs(Software Tools and Environment) 
 
Software delivers the most important product of our time called information. It transforms personal 
data (Individual financial transactions), It manages business information, It provides gateway to 
worldwide information networks (Internet) and provides the means for acquiring information in all 
of its forms. 
 
1.1.1 Software 
 
Defining Software : Software is defined as 
 
1. Instructions : Programs that when executed provide desired function, features, and 
performance. 
2. Data structures: Enable the programs to adequately manipulate information. 
3. Documents: Descriptive information in both hard copy and virtual forms that describes the 
operation and use of the programs. 
Characteristics of software 
 
Software has characteristics that are considerably different than those of hardware: 
 
1) Software is developed or engineered; it is not manufactured in the Classical Sense. 
 
 Although some similarities exist between software development and hardware 
manufacturing, the two activities are fundamentally different.
 In both activities, high quality is achieved through good design, but the manufacturing phase 
for hardware can introduce quality problems that are nonexistent or easily corrected for 
software.
 Both the activities are dependent on people, but the relationship between people is totally 
varying. These two activities require the construction of a "product" but the approaches are 
different.
 Software costs are concentrated in engineering which means that software projects cannot 
be managed as if they were manufacturing.
 
2) Software doesn’t “Wear Out” 
 In early stage of hardware development process the failure rate is very high due to 
manufacturing defects, but after correcting defects failure rate gets reduced.
 Hardware components suffer from the growing effects of many other environmental 
factors. Stated simply, the hardware begins to wear out.
 Software is not susceptible to the environmental maladies (extreme temperature, dusts and 
vibrations) that cause hardware to wear out [Fig:1.1]
The following figure shows the relationship between failure rate and time. 

SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT (BCS501) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 When a hardware component wears out, it is replaced by a spare part. There are no software 
spare parts.
 Every software failure indicates an error in design or in the process through which the design 
was translated into machine-executable code. Therefore, the software maintenance tasks that 
accommodate requests for change involve considerably more complexity than hardware 
maintenance. However, the implication is clear—the software doesn’t wear out. But it does 
deteriorate (frequent changes in requirement) [Fig:1.2].
 
 
 A software part should be planned and carried out with the goal that it tends to be reused in 
various projects (algorithms and data structures).
 Today software industry is trying to make library of reusable components E.g. Software GUI 
is built using the reusable components such as message windows, pull down menu and many 
more such components.
 In the hardware world, component reuse is a natural part of the engineering process.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3) Most Software is custom-built rather than being assembled from components: 

SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT (BCS501) 
 
 
 
1.1.2 Software Application Domains 
Nowadays, seven broad categories of computer software present continuing challenges for software 
engineers: 
 
1. System Software: 
 A collection of programs written to service other programs. Some system software 
(e.g., compilers, editors, and file management utilities). Other system applications 
(e.g. Operating system components, drivers, networking software, telecommunication 
processors) process largely indeterminate data. 
  In both cases there is heavy interaction with computer hardware, heavy usage by 
multiple users, scheduling and resource sharing. 
2. Application Software: 
 Stand-alone programs that solve a specific business need. [Help users to perform 
specific tasks]. 
 Application software is used to control business functions in real time (e.g., point-of- 
sale transaction processing, real-time manufacturing process control). 
3. Engineering/Scientific Software: 
 It has been characterized by “number crunching” algorithms. (Complex numeric 
computations). 
 Applications range from astronomy to volcanology, from automotive stress analysis 
to space shuttle orbital dynamics, and from molecular biology to automated 
manufacturing. Computer-aided design, system simulation, and other interactive 
applications have begun to take a real-time and even system software characteristic. 
4. Embedded Software: 
 It resides within a product or system and is used to implement and control features 
and functions for the end user and for the system itself. 
 Embedded software can perform limited and esoteric functions (e.g., keypad control 
for a microwave oven) or provide significant function and control capability (e.g., 
digital functions in an automobile such as fuel control dashboard displays, and 
braking systems). 
5. Product-line Software: 
 Designed to provide a specific capability for use by many different customers. 
 Product-line software can focus on a limited and esoteric marketplace (e.g., 
inventory control products) or address mass consumer markets (e.g., word 
processing, spreadsheets, computer graphics, multimedia, entertainment, database 
management, and personal and business financial applications). 
6. Web Applications: 
 It is a client-server computer program that the client runs on the web browser. 

SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT (BCS501) 
 
 
 
 These applications are called “WebApps,” this network-centric software category 
spans a wide array of applications. In their simplest form, WebApps can be little 
more than a set of linked hypertext files that present information using text and 
limited graphics. 
 
7. Artificial Intelligence Software: 
 These makes use of non-numerical algorithms to solve complex problems. 
Knowledge based expert systems. 
 Applications within this area include robotics, expert systems, pattern recognition 
(image and voice), artificial neural networks, theorem proving, and game playing. 
New Software Challenges: 
 Open-world computing: Creating software to allow machines of all sizes to communicate 
with each other across vast networks (Distributed computing—wireless networks). 
 
 Net sourcing: Architecting simple and sophisticated applications that benefit targeted end- 
user markets worldwide (the Web as a computing engine). 
 
 Open Source: Distributing source code for computing applications so customers can make 
local modifications easily and reliably ( “free” source code open to the computing 
community). 
 
1.1.3 Legacy Software 
 
 Legacy software is older programs that are developed decades ago. 
 The quality of legacy software is poor because it has inextensible design, convoluted 
code, poor and nonexistent documentation, test cases and results that are not 
achieved. 
 
As time passes legacy systems evolve due to following reasons: 
 
  The software must be adapted to meet the needs of new computing environment 
or technology. 
 The software must be enhanced to implement new business requirements. 
 
  The software must be extended to make it interoperable with more modern 
systems or database. 
 
  The software must be re-architected to make it viable within a network 
environment. 

SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT (BCS501) 
 
 
 
1.2 Unique Nature of Web Apps 
In the early days of the World Wide Web (1990-95), websites consisted of little more than a set of 
linked hypertext files (HTML) that presented information using text and limited graphics. As 
time passed, the augmentation of HTML by development tools (e.g., XML, Java) enabled Web 
engineers to provide computing capability along with informational content. 
 
Web-based systems and applications (WebApps) were born. Today, WebApps have evolved into 
sophisticated computing tools that not only provide stand-alone function to the end user, but also 
have been integrated with corporate databases and business applications. 
 
WebApps are one of a number of distinct software categories. Web-based systems and 
applications “involve a mixture between print publishing and software development, between 
marketing and computing, between internal communications and external relations, and between art 
and technology.” 
 
The following attributes are encountered in the vast majority of WebApps. 
 
 Network intensiveness. A WebApp resides on a network and must serve the needs of a 
diverse community of clients. The network may enable worldwide access and 
communication (i.e., the Internet) or more limited access and communication (e.g., a 
corporate Intranet). 
 Concurrency. A large number of users may access the WebApp at one time. In many cases, 
the patterns of usage among end users will vary greatly. 
 
 Unpredictable load. The number of users of the WebApp may vary by orders of magnitude 
from day to day. One hundred users may show up on Monday; 10,000 may use the system 
on Thursday. 
 
 Performance. WebApp should work effectively in terms of processing speed. If a WebApp 
user must wait too long (for access, for server-side processing, for client-side formatting and 
display), he or she may decide to go elsewhere. 
 Availability. Although expectation of 100 percent availability is un reasonable, users of 
popular WebApps often demand access on a 24/7/365 basis . 
 
 Data driven. The primary function of many WebApps is to use hypermedia to present text, 
graphics, audio, and video content to the end user. In addition, WebApps are commonly used 
to access information that exists on databases that are not an integral part of the Web- based 
environment (e.g., e-commerce or financial applications). 
 
 Content sensitive. The quality and aesthetic nature of content remains an important 
determinant of the quality of a WebApp. 

SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT (BCS501) 
 
 
 
 Continuous evolution. Unlike conventional application software that evolves over a series 
of planned, chronologically spaced releases, Web applications evolve continuously. 
  Immediacy. Although immediacy—the compelling need to get software to market 
quickly—is a characteristic of many application domains, WebApps often exhibit a time- to-
market that can be a matter of a few days or weeks. 
 
 Security. Because WebApps are available via network access, it is difficult, if not 
impossible, to limit the population of end users who may access the application. In order to 
protect sensitive content and provide secure modes 
 
 Aesthetics. An undeniable part of the appeal of a WebApp is its look and feel. When an 
application has been designed to market or sell products or ideas, aesthetics may have as 
much to do with success as technical design. 
 
1.3 Software Engineering -A Layered Technology 
In order to build software that is ready to meet the challenges of the 21st century, you 
must recognize a few simple realities. 
 
 
Problems should be understood before a software solution is developed. 
 
 
Design is a pivotal Software Engineering activity. 
 
 
Software should exhibit high quality. 
 
 
Software should be maintainable 
 
These simple realities lead to one conclusion. Software in all of its forms and across all of its 
application domains should be engineered. 
 
Software Engineering: 
Fritz Bauer defined as: 
 
Software engineering is the establishment and use of sound engineering principles in order to 
obtain software that is reliable and works efficiently on real machines in economical manner. 
 
IEEE has developed a more comprehensive definition as: 
 
1) Software engineering is the application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to 
the development, operation, and maintenance of software. 
 
2) The study approaches as in (1) 

SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT (BCS501) 
 
 
 
Software Engineering is a layered technology. Software Engineering encompasses a Process, 
Methods for managing and engineering software and tools. 
 
Software engineering is a fully layered technology, to develop software we need to go from one 
layer to another. All the layers are connected and each layer demands the fulfillment of the previous 
layer.[Fig:1.3] 
 
 
Software engineering is a layered technology. Referring to above Figure, any engineering 
approach must rest on an organizational commitment to quality. 
 
 
The bedrock that supports software engineering is a quality focus. 
 
 
The foundation for software engineering is the process layer. The software engineering 
process is the glue that holds the technology layers together and enables rational and timely 
development of computer software. Process defines a framework that must be established 
for effective delivery of software engineering technology. 
 
 
Software engineering methods provide the technical how-to’s for building software. 
Methods encompass a broad array of tasks that include communication, requirements 
analysis,  design  modeling,  program  construction,  testing,  and  support. 
 
Software engineering tools provide automated or semi-automated support for the process 
and the methods. When tools are integrated so that information created by one tool can be 
used by another, a system for the support of software development, called computer-aided 
software engineering is established. 
 
1.4 THE SOFTWARE PROCESS 
A process is a collection of activities, actions, and tasks that are performed when some 
work product is to be created. 

SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT (BCS501) 
 
 
 
An activity strives to achieve a broad objective (e.g. communication with stakeholders) and 
is applied regardless of the application domain, size of the project, complexity of the effort, or degree 
of rigor with which software engineering is to be applied. 
 
An action encompasses a set of tasks that produce a major work product (e.g., an 
architectural design model). 
 
A task focuses on a small, but well-defined objective (e.g., conducting a unit test) that 
produces a tangible outcome. 
 
A process framework establishes the foundation for a complete software engineering process by 
identifying a small number of framework activities that are applicable to all software projects, 
regardless of their size or complexity. In addition, the process framework encompasses a set of 
umbrella activities that are applicable across the entire software process. 
 
A generic process framework for software engineering encompasses five activities: 
 
Communication. Before any technical work can commence, it is critically important to 
communicate and collaborate with the customer. The intent is to ‘understand stakeholders’ 
objectives for the project and to gather requirements that help define software features and 
functions. 
 
Planning. A software project is a complicated journey, and the planning activity creates a 
“map” that helps guide the team as it makes the journey. The map—called a software project 
plan—defines the software engineering work by describing the technical tasks to be 
conducted, the risks that are likely, the resources that will be required, the work products to 
be produced, and a work schedule. 
 
 
Modeling. Creation of models to help developers and customers understand the requirements 
and software design. 
 
 
Construction. This activity combines code generation and the testing that is required to 
uncover errors in the code. 
 
 
Deployment. The software is delivered to the customer who evaluates the delivered product 
and provides feedback based on the evaluation. 
 
These five generic framework activities can be used during the development of small, simple 
programs, the creation of large Web applications, and for the engineering of large, complex 
computer-based systems. 
 
Software engineering process framework activities are complemented by a number of Umbrella 
Activities. In general, umbrella activities are applied throughout a software project and help a 
software team manage and control progress, quality, change, and risk. 

SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT (BCS501) 
 
 
 
Typical umbrella activities include: 
 Software project tracking and control—allows the software team to assess progress against 
the project plan and take any necessary action to maintain the schedule. 
  Risk management—assesses risks that may affect the outcome of the project or the quality 
of the product. 
 
 Software quality assurance—defines and conducts the activities required to ensure software 
quality. 
 
 Technical reviews—assesses software engineering work products in an effort to uncover and 
remove errors before they are propagated to the next activity. 
 
 Measurement—defines and collects process, project, and product measures that assist the 
team in delivering software that meets stakeholders needs; can be used in conjunction with all 
other framework and umbrella activities. 
 
 Software configuration management—manages the effects of change throughout the 
software process. 
 
  Reusability management—defines criteria for work product reuse and establishes 
mechanisms to achieve reusable components. 
 
  Work product preparation and production—encompasses the activities required to create 
work products such as models, documents, logs, forms, and lists. 
 
The Software Engineering process is not rigid---It should be agile and adaptable. Therefore, a 
process adopted for one project might be significantly different than a process adopted for another 
project. 
Among the differences are: 
 
 Overall flow and level of interdependencies among tasks 
 
 
Degree to which work tasks are defined within each framework activity 
 
 
Degree to which work products are identified and required 
 
 Manner in which quality assurance activities are applied 
 
 
Manner in which project tracking and control activities are applied 
 
 Overall degree of detail and rigor of process description 

SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT (BCS501) 
 
 
 
 
Degree to which stakeholders are involved in the project 
 
 Level of autonomy given to project team 
 
 
Degree to which team organization and roles are prescribed 
 
1.5 THE SOFTWARE ENGINEERING PRACTICE 
Generic concepts and principles that apply to framework activities: 
1.5.1 The Essence of Practice 
 Understand the problem (communication and analysis) 
 Plan a solution (software design) 
 Carry out the plan (code generation) 
 Examine the result for accuracy (testing and quality assurance). 
These steps lead to series of questions: 
 
Understand the Problem 
 Who are the stakeholders? 
 
What are the Unknowns? What functions and features are required to solve the problem? 
 
Is it possible to create smaller problems that are easier to understand? 
 Can a graphic analysis model be created? 
 
Plan the Solution 
 Have you seen similar problems before? Is there existing software that implements these 
features. 
 Has a similar problem been solved? ‘ 
 Can readily solvable sub problems be defined? 
 Can a design model be created? –Effective implementation. 
Carry Out the Plan 
 
Does solution conform to the plan? Is source code traceable to the design model? 
 
Is each solution component provably, correct? Have design and code be reviewed? 
 
Examine the Result 
 Is it possible to test each component part of the solution? 
 Does the solution produce results that conform to the data, functions, and features 
required? 

SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT (BCS501) 
 
 
 
1.5.2 Software General Principles 
The dictionary defines the word principle as “an important underlying law or assumption 
required in a system of thought.” David Hooker has Proposed seven principles that focus on software 
Engineering practice. 
 
The First Principle: The Reason It All Exists 
A software system exists for one reason: to provide value to its users. 
 
The Second Principle: KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid!) 
Software design is not a haphazard process. There are many factors to consider in any design 
effort. All design should be as simple as possible, but no simpler. 
 
The Third Principle: Maintain the Vision 
A clear vision is essential to the success of a software project. Without one, a project almost 
unfailingly ends up being “of two [or more] minds” about itself. 
 
The Fourth Principle: What You Produce, Others Will Consume 
Always specify, design, and implement knowing someone else will have to understand what 
you are doing. 
 
The Fifth Principle: Be Open to the Future A system with a long lifetime has more value. Never 
design yourself into a corner. Before beginning a software project, be sure the software has a 
business purpose and that users perceive value in it. 
 
The Sixth Principle: Plan Ahead for Reuse Reuse saves time and effort. Planning ahead for reuse 
reduces the cost and increases the value of both the reusable components and the systems into which 
they are incorporated. 
 
The Seventh principle: Think! Placing clear, complete thought before action almost always 
produces better results. When you think about something, you are more likely to do it right. 
 
1.6 SOFTWARE MYTHS 
Software Myths- beliefs about software and the process used to build it - can be traced to the earliest 
days of computing. Myths have a number of attributes that have made them insidious. For instance, 
myths appear to be reasonable statements of fact, they have an intuitive feel, and they are often 
promulgated by experienced practitioners who “know the score”. 
 
Management Myths: 
Managers with software responsibility, like managers in most disciplines, are often under pressure 
to maintain budgets, keep schedules from slipping, and improve quality. Like a drowning person 
who grasps at a straw, a software manager often grasps at belief in a software myth. 

SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT (BCS501) 
 
 
 
Myth: We already have a book that’s full of standards and procedures for building software. 
Won’t that provide my people with everything they need to know? 
Reality: 
 The book of standards may very well exist, but is it used? 
 Are software practitioners aware of its existence? 
 Does it reflect modern software engineering practice? 
 Is it complete? 
 Is it adaptable? 
 
Is it streamlined to improve time to delivery while still maintaining a focus on Quality? 
 
In many cases, the answer to this entire question is NO. 
 
Myth: If we get behind schedule, we can add more programmers and catch up 
 
Reality: Software development is not a mechanistic process like manufacturing. “Adding people to 
a late software project makes it later.” At first, this statement may seem counterintuitive. However, 
as new people are added, people who were working must spend time educating the newcomers, 
thereby reducing the amount of time spent on productive development effort. 
People can be added but only in a planned and well-coordinated manner. 
 
Myth: If we decide to outsource the software project to a third party, I can just relax and let that 
firm build it. 
 
Reality: If an organization does not understand how to manage and control software project 
internally, it will invariably struggle when it out sources’ software project. 
 
Customer Myths: 
A customer who requests computer software may be a person at the next desk, a technical group 
down the hall, the marketing /sales department, or an outside company that has requested software 
under contract. In many cases, the customer believes myths about software because software 
managers and practitioners do little to correct misinformation. Myths led to false expectations and 
ultimately, dissatisfaction with the developers. 
Myth: A general statement of objectives is sufficient to begin writing programs - we can fill in 
details later. 
 
Reality: Although a comprehensive and stable statement of requirements is not always possible, an 
ambiguous statement of objectives is a recipe for disaster. Unambiguous requirements are developed 
only through effective and continuous communication between customer and developer. 

SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT (BCS501) 
 
 
 
Myth: Project requirements continually change, but change can be easily accommodated because 
software is flexible. 
Reality: It’s true that software requirement change, but the impact of change varies with the time at 
which it is introduced. When requirement changes are requested early, cost impact is relatively 
small. However, as time passes, cost impact grows rapidly – resources have been committed, a 
design framework has been established, and change can cause upheaval that requires additional 
resources and major design modification. 
 
Practitioner's myths. 
Myths that are still believed by software practitioners have been fostered by 50 years of 
programming culture. During the early days of software, programming was viewed as an art form. 
Old ways and attitudes die hard. 
 
Myth: Once we write the program and get it to work, our job is done. 
 
Reality: Someone once said that "the sooner you begin 'writing code', the longer it'll take you to get 
done.” Industry data indicate that between 60 and 80 percent of all effort consumed on software will 
be consumed after it is delivered to the customer for the first time. 
 
Myth: Until I get the program "running" I have no way of assessing its quality. 
 
Reality: One of the most effective software quality assurance mechanisms can be applied from the 
inception of a project—the formal technical review. Software reviews are a "quality filter" that have 
been found to be more effective than testing for finding certain classes of software defects. 
 
Myth: The only deliverable work product for a successful project is the working program. 
 
Reality: A working program is only one part of a software configuration that includes many 
elements. Documentation provides a foundation for successful engineering and, more important, 
guidance for software support. 
 
Myth: Software engineering will make us create voluminous and unnecessary documentation and 
will invariably slow us down. 
Reality: Software engineering is not about creating documents. It is about creating quality. Better 
quality leads to reduced rework. And reduced rework results in faster delivery times. Many software 
professionals recognize the fallacy of the myths just described. Regrettably, habitual attitudes and 
methods foster poor management and technical practices, even when reality dictates a better 
approach. Recognition of software realities is the first step toward formulation of practical solutions 
for software engineering.

MODULE 1 
CHAPTER 2-- PROCESS MODELS 
 
2.1 A GENERIC PROCESS MODEL 
 
A process was defined as a collection of work activities, actions, and tasks that are performed when 
some work product is to be created. Each of these activities, actions, and tasks reside within a 
framework or model that defines their relationship with the process and with one another. 
The software process is represented schematically in Figure 2.1. Each framework activity is 
populated by a set of software engineering actions. Each software engineering action is defined by 
a task set that identifies the work tasks that are to be completed, the work products that will be 
produced, the quality assurance points that will be required, and the milestones that will be used 
to indicate progress. 
 
 
As I discussed in Chapter 1, a generic process framework for software engineering defines five 
framework activities—communication, planning, modeling, construction, and deployment. In 
addition, a set of umbrella activities—project tracking and control, risk management, quality 

SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT (BCS501) 
 
 
 
assurance, configuration management, technical reviews, and others—are applied throughout 
the process. 
 
The important aspect of software process is “Process Flow” which describes how the framework 
activities and the actions and tasks that occur within each framework activity are organized with 
respect to sequence and time and is illustrated in Figure 2.2. 
 
 
 
 
A linear process [Fig:2.2(a)] flow executes each of the five framework activities in sequence, 
beginning with communication and culminating with deployment. 
 
An iterative process flow [Fig:2.2(b)] repeats one or more of the activities before proceeding to 
the next. 
 
An evolutionary process flow [Fig:2.2(c)] executes the activities in a “circular” manner. Each 
circuit through the five activities leads to a more complete version of the software. 

SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT (BCS501) 
 
 
 
A parallel process flow [Fig:2.2(d)] executes one or more activities in parallel with other activities 
(e.g. modeling for one aspect of the software might be executed in parallel with construction of 
another aspect of the software). 
 
2.1.1 Defining a Framework Activity 
 
There are five framework activities, they are 
o communication, 
o planning, 
o modeling, 
o construction, and 
o deployment. 
These five framework activities provide a basic definition of Software Process. These Framework 
activities provides basic information like What actions are appropriate for a framework activity, 
given the nature of the problem to be solved, the characteristics of the people doing the work, and 
the stakeholders who are sponsoring the project? 
 
1. Make contact with stakeholder via telephone. 
2. Discuss requirements and take notes. 
3. Organize notes into a brief written statement of requirements. 
4. E-mail to stakeholder for review and approval. 
 
If the project was considerably more complex with many stakeholders, each with a different set of 
requirements, the communication activity might have six distinct actions: inception, elicitation, 
elaboration, negotiation, specification, and validation. Each of these software engineering actions 
would have many work tasks and a number of distinct work products. 
 
2.1.2 Identifying a Task Set 
 Each software engineering action can be represented by a number of different task sets 
 Each a collection of software engineering o work tasks, 
o related work products, 
o 
quality assurance points, and 
o 
project milestones. 
 Choose a task set that best accommodates the needs of the project and the characteristics 
of software team. 
 This implies that a software engineering action can be adapted to the specific needs of the 
software project and the characteristics of the project team. 
2.1.3 Process Patterns 
 
A process pattern describes a process-related problem that is encountered during software 
engineering work, identifies the environment in which the problem has been encountered, and 

SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT (BCS501) 
 
 
 
suggests one or more proven solutions to the problem. Stated in more general terms, a process pattern 
provides you with a template —a consistent method for describing problem solutions within the 
context of the software process. 
 
Patterns can be defined at any level of abstraction. a pattern might be used to describe a problem 
(and solution) associated with a complete process model (e.g., prototyping). In other situations, 
patterns can be used to describe a problem (and solution) associated with a framework activity (e.g., 
planning) or an action within a framework activity (e.g., project estimating). 
 
Ambler has proposed a template for describing a process pattern: 
 
1. Pattern Name. The pattern is given a meaningful name describing it within the context of the 
software process (e.g., Technical Reviews). 
 
2. Forces. The environment in which the pattern is encountered and the issues that make the 
problem visible and may affect its solution. 
3. Type. The pattern type is specified. Ambler suggests three types: 
I. 
Stage pattern—Defines a problem associated with a framework activity for the process. 
Since a framework activity encompasses multiple actions and work tasks, a stage pattern 
incorporates multiple task patterns that are relevant to the stage (framework activity). 
E.g.: Establishing Communication. 
This pattern would incorporate the task pattern RequirementsGathering and others. 
 
II. 
Task pattern—Defines a problem associated with a software engineering action or 
work task and relevant to successful software engineering practice (e.g., Requirements 
Gathering). 
 
III. 
Phase pattern—Define the sequence of framework activities that occurs within the 
process, even when the overall flow of activities is iterative in nature. E.g: SpiralModel 
or Prototyping. 
 
4. Initial context. Describes the conditions under which the pattern applies. Prior to 
the initiation of the pattern: 
(1) What organizational or team-related activities have already occurred? 
(2) What is the entry state for the process? 
(3) What software engineering information or project information already exists? 
 
5. 
Problem. The specific problem to be solved by the pattern. 
 
6. Solution. Describes how to implement the pattern successfully. It also describes how 
software engineering information or project information that is available before the initiation 
of the pattern is transformed as a consequence of the successful execution of the pattern. 

SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT (BCS501) 
 
 
 
7. Resulting Context. Describes the conditions that will result once the pattern has been 
successfully implemented. Upon completion of the pattern: 
(1) What organizational or team-related activities must have occurred? 
(2) What is the exit state for the process? 
(3) What software engineering information or project information has been developed? 
 
8. Related Patterns. Provide a list of all process patterns that are directly related to this one. 
This may be represented as a hierarchy or in some other diagrammatic form. 
 
9. Known Uses and Examples. Indicate the specific instances in which the pattern is 
applicable. 
 
Conclusion on Process patterns 
 Provide an effective mechanism for addressing problems associated with any software 
process.
 The patterns enable you to develop a hierarchical process description that begins at a high 
level of abstraction (a phase pattern).
 The description is then refined into a set of stage patterns that describe framework activities
  Once process patterns have been developed, they can be reused for the definition of 
process variants.
 
2.2 PROCESS ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT 
The existence of a software process is no guarantee that software will be delivered on time, that 
it will meet the customer’s needs. 
Process patterns must be coupled with solid software engineering practice. 
Assessment attempts to understand the current state of the software process with the intent on 
improving it. 
 
A number of different approaches to software process assessment and improvement have been 
proposed over the past few decades. 
 
Standard CMMI Assessment Method for Process Improvement (SCAMPI)- Provides a 
five step process assessment model that incorporates five phases: initiating, diagnosing, 
establishing, acting, and learning. The SCAMPI method uses the SEI CMMI as the basis 
for assessment. 
 
CMM-Based Appraisal for Internal Process Improvement (CBA IPI)-Provides a 
diagnostic technique for assessing the relative maturity of a software organization; uses the 
SEI CMM as the basis for the assessment. 
 
SPICE (ISO/IEC15504)—a standard that defines a set of requirements for software process 

SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT (BCS501) 
 
 
 
assessment. The intent of the standard is to assist organizations in developing an objective 
evaluation of the efficacy of any defined software process. 
 
ISO 9001:2000 for Software—a generic standard that applies to any organization that wants 
to improve the overall quality of the products, systems, or services that it provides. Therefore, 
the standard is directly applicable to software organizations and companies.

2.3 PRESCRIPTIVE PROCESS MODELS 
Prescriptive process models were originally proposed to bring order to the chaos (disorder) 
of software development. 
 These models have brought a certain amount of useful structure to software engineering 
work and have provided a reasonably effective road map for software teams. 
  The edge of chaos is defined as “a natural state between order and chaos, a grand 
compromise between structure and surprise”. 
 The edge of chaos can be visualized as an unstable, partially structured state. 
 It is unstable because it is constantly attracted to chaos or to absolute order. 
 The prescriptive process approach in which order and project consistency are dominant 
issues. 
 “prescriptive” means prescribe a set of process elements 
o framework activities, 
o software engineering actions, 
o tasks, 
o work products, 
o quality assurance, and 
o change control mechanisms for each project. 

SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT (BCS501) 
 
 
 
 Each process model also prescribes a process flow (also called a work flow)—that is, the 
manner in which the process elements are interrelated to one another. 
  All software process models can accommodate the generic framework activities, but each 
applies a different emphasis to these activities and defines a process flow that invokes each 
framework activity in a different manner. 
The Waterfall Model 
The waterfall model, Fig [2.3] sometimes called the classic life cycle, suggests a systematic, 
sequential approach to software development that begins with customer specification of 
requirements and progresses through planning, modeling, construction, and deployment. 
 
 
 
V- model 
A variation in the representation of the waterfall model is called the V-model. represented 
in the following Fig:2.4. The V-model depicts the relationship of quality assurance actions to the 
actions associated with communication, modeling, and early construction activities. 
 

SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT (BCS501) 
 
 
 
 
As a software team moves down the left side of the V, basic problem requirements are refined 
into progressively more detailed and technical representations of the problem and its solution. Once 
code has been generated, the team moves up the right side of the V, essentially performing a series 
of tests that validate each of the models created as the team moved down the left side. The V-model 
provides a way of visualizing how verification and validation actions are applied to earlier 
engineering work. 
 
The waterfall model is the oldest paradigm for software engineering. The problems that are 
sometimes encountered when the waterfall model is applied are: 
 
1. Real projects rarely follow the sequential flow that the model proposes. Although a linear 
model can accommodate iteration, it does so indirectly. As a result, changes can cause 
confusion as the project team proceeds. 
 
2. It is often difficult for the customer to state all requirements explicitly. The waterfall model 
requires this and has difficulty accommodating the natural uncertainty that exists at the 
beginning of many projects. 
3.  The customer must have patience. A working version of the program(s) will not be available 
until late in the project time span. 
 
This model is suitable whenever limited number of new development efforts and when 
requirements are well defined and reasonably stable. 
 
2.4 INCREMENTAL PROCESS MODELS 
The incremental model delivers a series of releases, called increments, that provide 
progressively more functionality for the customer as each increment is delivered. 
 
The incremental model combines elements of linear and parallel process flows. Referring 
to Fig 2.5 The incremental model applies linear sequences in a staggered fashion as calendar time 
progresses. Each linear sequence produces deliverable “increments” of the software in a manner that 
is similar to the increments produced by an evolutionary process flow. 
 
For example, word-processing software developed using the incremental paradigm might 
deliver basic file management, editing, and document production functions in the first increment; 
more sophisticated editing and document production capabilities in the second increment; spelling 
and grammar checking in the third increment; and advanced page layout capability in the fourth 
increment. 
 
 When an incremental model is used, the first increment is often a core product. That is, 
basic requirements are addressed but many extra features remain undelivered. The core 
product is used by the customer. As a result of use and/or evaluation, a plan is developed 

SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT (BCS501) 
 
 
 
for the next increment. 
 The plan addresses the modification of the core product to better meet the needs of the 
customer and the delivery of additional features and functionality. This process is repeated 
following the delivery of each increment, until the complete product is produced. 
 
 Incremental development is particularly useful when staffing is unavailable for a complete 
implementation by the business deadline that has been established for the project. Early 
increments can be implemented with fewer people. If the core product is well received, then 
additional staff (if required) can be added to implement the next increment. In addition, 
increments can be planned to manage technical risks. 
 
 
 
 
 
2.5 EVOLUTIONARY PROCESS MODELS 
Evolutionary models are iterative. They are characterized in a manner that enables you to 
develop increasingly more complete versions of the software with each iteration. There are two 
common evolutionary process models. 
 
2.5.1 Prototyping Model 
Often, a customer defines a set of general objectives for software, but does not identify 
detailed requirements for functions and features. In other cases, the developer may be unsure of the 

SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT (BCS501) 
 
 
 
efficiency of an algorithm, the adaptability of an operating system, or the form that human- machine 
interaction should take. In these, and many other situations, a prototyping paradigm may offer the 
best approach. 
 
Although prototyping can be used as a stand-alone process model, it is more commonly used 
as a technique that can be implemented within the context of any one of the process models. 
 
The prototyping paradigm FIG:2.6 begins with communication. You meet with other 
stakeholders to define the overall objectives for the software, identify whatever requirements are 
known, and outline areas where further definition is mandatory. A prototyping iteration is planned 
quickly, and modeling (in the form of a “quick design”) occurs. A quick design focuses on a 
representation of those aspects of the software that will be visible to end users. 
 
The quick design leads to the construction of a prototype. The prototype is deployed and evaluated 
by stakeholders, who provide feedback that is used to further refine requirements. 
Iteration occurs as the prototype is tuned to satisfy the needs of various stakeholders, while at the 
same time enabling you to better understand what needs to be done. 
 
The prototype serves as a mechanism for identifying software requirements. If a working prototype 
is to be built, you can make use of existing program fragments or apply tools that enable working 
programs to be generated quickly. The prototype can serve as “the first system.” 
 
Prototyping can be problematic for the following reasons: 
1. Stakeholders see what appears to be a working version of the software, unaware that the 
prototype is held together randomly, unaware that in the rush to get it working you haven’t 
considered overall software quality or long-term maintainability. 

SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT (BCS501) 
 
 
 
2. As a software engineer, you often make implementation compromises in order to get a 
prototype working quickly. An inappropriate operating system or programming language 
may be used simply because it is available and known; an inefficient algorithm may be 
implemented simply to demonstrate capability. 
 
Although problems can occur, prototyping can be an effective paradigm for software 
engineering. 
 
2.5.2 The Spiral Model: 
Originally proposed by Barry Boehm, the spiral model is an evolutionary software process 
model that couples the iterative nature of prototyping with the controlled and systematic aspects of 
the waterfall model. It provides the potential for rapid development of increasingly more complete 
versions of the software. Boehm describes the model in the following manner. 
 
The spiral development model is a risk-driven process model generator that is used to guide 
multi-stakeholder concurrent engineering of software intensive systems. It has two main 
distinguishing features. One is a cyclic approach for incrementally growing a system’s degree of 
definition and implementation while decreasing its degree of risk. The other is a set of anchor point 
milestones for ensuring stakeholder commitment to feasible and mutually satisfactory system 
solutions. 
 
Using the spiral model, software is developed in a series of evolutionary releases. During 
early iterations, the release might be a model or prototype. During later iterations, increasingly more 
complete versions of the engineered system are produced. 
 

SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT (BCS501) 
 
 
 
 
A spiral model is divided into a set of framework activities defined by the software 
engineering team.[Fig:2.7] As this evolutionary process begins, the software team performs 
activities that are implied by a circuit around the spiral in a clockwise direction, beginning at the 
center. 
Risk is considered as each revolution is made. Anchor point milestones are a combination of 
work products and conditions that are attained along the path of the spiral are noted for each 
evolutionary pass. 
 
The first circuit around the spiral might result in the development of a product specification; 
subsequent passes around the spiral might be used to develop a prototype and then progressively 
more sophisticated versions of the software. Each pass through the planning region results in 
adjustments to the project plan. 
 
The spiral model can be adapted to apply throughout the life of the computer software. 
Therefore, the first circuit around the spiral might represent a “concept development project” 
that starts at the core of the spiral and continues for multiple iterations until concept development 
is complete. The new product will evolve through a number of iterations around the spiral. Later, a 
circuit around the spiral might be used to represent a “product enhancement project.” 
The spiral model is a realistic approach to the development of large-scale systems and 
software. Because software evolves as the process progresses, the developer and customer better 
understand and react to risks at each evolutionary level. It maintains the systematic stepwise 
approach suggested by the classic life cycle but incorporates it into an iterative framework that 
more realistically reflects the real world. 
 
2.6 CONCURRENT MODELS 
The concurrent development model sometimes called as concurrent engineering can be 
represented schematically as a series of framework activities, actions, tasks and their associated 
rules. 
The Fig 2.8 represents on Software Engineering activity within the modelling activity using a 
concurrent model approach. 

SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT (BCS501) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The activity modelling may be in any one of the states noted at any given time, similarly 
other activities, actions or tasks (Communication, Construction) can be represented in analogous 
manner. 
All Software Engineering activities exist concurrently but reside in different states. E.g. Early 
in a project the communication activity has completed its 1st iteration and exists in the awaiting 
changes state. 
The modelling activity (which existed in inactive state) while initial communication was 
completed now make a transition into the under-development state. 
If however, the customer indicates that changes in requirement must be made, the modelling 
activity moves from under-development state to awaiting changes state. 
Concurrent modelling defines a series of events that will trigger transitions from state to state 
for each of the software engineering activities, actions or tasks. 
Concurrent modelling is applicable for all types of software development and provides an 
accurate picture of the current state of the project. 
2.7 SPECIALIZED PROCESS MODELS 
2.7.1 Component-Based Development 
 
The component-based development model incorporates many of the characteristics of the 
spiral model. It is evolutionary in nature, demanding an iterative approach to the creation of 

SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT (BCS501) 
 
 
 
software. However, the component-based development model constructs applications from 
prepackaged software components. 
 
 
Modeling and construction activities begin with the identification of candidate components. 
These components can be designed as either conventional software modules or object- 
oriented classes or packages of classes. Regardless of the technology that is used to create 
the components. 
 
 
The component-based development model incorporates the following steps 
1. Available component-based products are researched and evaluated for the application 
domain in question. 
2. Component integration issues are considered. 
3. A software architecture is designed to accommodate the components. 
4. Components are integrated into the architecture. 
5. Comprehensive testing is conducted to ensure proper functionality. 
 
The component-based development model leads to software reuse, and reusability provides 
software engineers with a number of measurable benefits. 
 
2.7.2 The Formal Methods Model 
 
The formal methods model encompasses a set of activities that leads to formal mathematical 
specification of computer software. 
 
 
Formal methods enable you to specify, develop, and verify a computer-based system by 
applying a rigorous, mathematical notation. A variation on this approach, called 
clean room software engineering. 
 
 
When formal methods are used during development, they provide a mechanism for 
eliminating many of the problems that are difficult to overcome using other software 
engineering paradigms. Ambiguity, incompleteness, and inconsistency can be discovered 
and corrected more easily, but through the application of mathematical analysis. 
 
 
When formal methods are used during design, they serve as a basis for program verification 
which discover and correct errors that might otherwise go undetected. The formal methods 
model offers the promise of defect-free software. 
 
Draw Backs: 
 
• The development of formal models is currently quite time consuming and expensive. 
 
•  Because few software developers have the necessary background to apply formal 
methods, extensive training is required. 
 
• It is difficult to use the models as a communication mechanism for Technically 

SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT (BCS501) 
 
 
 
unsophisticated customers. 
 
2.7.3 Aspect-Oriented Software Development 
 
AOSD defines “aspects” that express customer concerns that cut across multiple system 
functions, features, and information. When concerns cut across multiple system functions, 
features, and information, they are often referred to as crosscutting concerns. Aspectual 
requirements define those crosscutting concerns that have an impact across the software 
architecture. 
 
 
Aspect-oriented software development (AOSD), often referred to as aspect-oriented 
programming (AOP), is a relatively new software engineering paradigm that provides a 
process and methodological approach for defining, specifying, designing, and constructing 
aspects.” 
 
Grundy provides further discussion of aspects in the context of what he calls aspect- oriented 
component engineering (AOCE): 
 
AOCE uses a concept of horizontal slices through vertically-decomposed software components, 
called “aspects,” to characterize cross-cutting functional and non-functional properties of 
components.
